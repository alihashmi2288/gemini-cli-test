# Gemini CLI Test Repository

This repository is a demonstration of the capabilities of the Gemini CLI, showcasing its ability to interact with and control GitHub repositories.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this repository is to serve as a testbed for the Gemini CLI's integration with GitHub via the MCP server. All the operations, from creating the repository itself to adding and modifying files, have been performed using the Gemini CLI.

## How it Works

The Gemini CLI leverages the MCP server to communicate with the GitHub API. This allows users to manage their GitHub repositories directly from the command line, using natural language commands. The Gemini CLI interprets these commands and translates them into the appropriate API calls to GitHub.

## What's Inside

*   **Repository Creation:** This repository was created using the `create_repository` command in the Gemini CLI.
*   **Folder and File Creation:** The `Test` folder and the `test.py` file within it were created using the `create_or_update_file` command.
*   **Code Generation:** The `calcultor-python.py` file, containing a scientific CLI calculator, was generated and added to the repository by the Gemini CLI.
*   **File Modification:** The `test.py` file was edited to print a different message, all through the Gemini CLI.

## Conclusion

This repository stands as a testament to the power and flexibility of the Gemini CLI. It demonstrates that complex workflows, such as creating repositories, managing files, and writing code, can be accomplished seamlessly through a conversational interface.
